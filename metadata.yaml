  _Bio: Space Exeko based on the concept of coworking, namely sharing the same space
    with several workers and organizations, including exchange of expertise, contacts
    and contracts. More broadly, there is room to take advantage of synergy and common
    services available at reasonable prices. Coworking is definitely an emerging trend
    as evidenced by the opening of similar spaces in Montreal, Barcelona, Paris or
    San Francisco. Space Exeko differs from the majority of coworking spaces in the
    sense that it is not only jobs for self-employed, but also office space for small
    organizations. Our desire is to make a space where cultural and social spheres
    meet there, to be born there intertwine ever more innovative initiatives.

- Name: geh8 Kunstraum und Ateliers e.V.
  URL: http://geh8.de/
  _Bio: 'geh8 art space and studiosÂ is an independently, artist-run, non-commercial
    art space. It was founded in 2007 in an old railway container terminal in Dresden.
    Since then, the location has become an important art space in Dresden. Because
    the structure houses both studios as well as a large exhibition hall, the character
    of the space is exceptionally unique.Â The coexistence of art production and presentation
    at the geh8 is part of what makes the space particularly special. This characteristic
    is expressed in the name: geh8 art space and studios. Artists who have their studios
    at geh8 develop and curate exhibitions in the main hall of the former railway
    terminal. This is an ideal setting for the discussion of current contemporary
    art issues. Additionally, geh8 is very interested in developing and expanding
    diverse cooperations with similar institutions on a local and international level.Â Because
    of the self governed model of geh8 and due to its non-commercial approach, geh8
    art space and studios is also able to support the realisation of unconventional
    and experimental ideas and exhibitions.'

  _Bio: ProjectÂ CoworkingClubÂ is one of the innovative business solutions implemented
    byÂ InnovationStep.Â Arose as a response to demand from the liberal professions
    (freelancers) and companies looking for custom solutions in the use of space to
    work. Despite the ability to carry out professional tasks at home or in an internet
    cafe, there is a large group of people who are not responding. Such people prefer
    to work in a separate, properly adapted office space. On the other hand, the cost
    of office rent to individuals is significant enough that it can effectively deter
    interested. The idea of the project CoworkingClub responds to such persons, reconciling
    these seemingly contradictory expectations, and even further by providing participants
    a range of other benefits.
