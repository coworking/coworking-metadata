OfficePort meets a soaring nationwide demand that is not and cannot be met in the traditional manner. What itâs not: It is the antithesis of the old leased-space model. It is not traditional, costly, environmentally repressive, isolated, economically unpredictable. It is not business as usual. Why it works: OfficePort is open, supportive, and affordable, without deposit or long-term commitment, completely turn-key without hidden costs. It is a concept born of todayâs needs.","contact":{"email":"courtney@officeportnetwork.com","phone":"816 994 7311"},"address":["500 Delaware",".",".","Kansas City","MO","64105","USA"],"Name":"Office Port - River Market"},{"info":{"places":"http://maps.google.com/maps/place?um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=office+space+coworking+akron&fb=1&gl=us&hq=office+space+coworking&hnear=Akron,+OH&cid=10816406015952494918","logo":"http://media1.px.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/38dh0tH1YI_b_S-zffvtPA/l","yelp":"http://www.yelp.com/biz/office-space-coworking-akron","facebook":"http://www.facebook.com/pages/Akron/Office-Space-Coworking/52052817350?ref=search"},"URL":"http://officespacecoworking.com/","geo":{"lat":"41.0733763","long":"-81.5228602"},"pay":{"dropin":{"free":"n"}},"_Bio":"Weâre fully furnished with everything you need to look and perform your best.
